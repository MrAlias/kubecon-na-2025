### Easy to Use

Just write markdown - the theme handles all styling automatically. No need to worry about CSS or layout details.

### Flexible

Use the layouts that make sense for your content. Mix and match as needed throughout your presentation.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Logo Updates

When KubeCon NA 2025 official logos are released, update the URLs in:

- `theme/layouts/cover.vue`
- `theme/layouts/end.vue`

### 2. Testing

Always test your presentation on the actual display you'll use (projector resolution, aspect ratio).

### 3. Content Length

The theme automatically handles scrolling if content is too long for one slide, but it's better to split into multiple slides.

### 4. Dark Mode

The theme is optimized for dark mode (typical for conference presentations). Test in your target environment.
