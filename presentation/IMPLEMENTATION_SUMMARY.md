Just write markdown - the theme handles all styling automatically. No need to worry about CSS or layout details.

### Flexible
Use the layouts that make sense for your content. Mix and match as needed throughout your presentation.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Logo Updates
When KubeCon NA 2025 official logos are released, update the URLs in:

### 2. Testing
Always test your presentation on the actual display you'll use (projector resolution, aspect ratio).

### 3. Content Length
The theme automatically handles scrolling if content is too long for one slide, but it's better to split into multiple slides.
